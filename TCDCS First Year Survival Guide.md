# TCDS First Year Survival Guide

## Introduction
Congratulations on making it into Computer Science at Trinity! Here is a list of things I wish I knew when I started out as a naive and uninformed fresher.

If you have any questions feel free to file an issue here on GitHub or you can reach me on discord through DMs @Lydia#3999 or the //TCDCD Discord Server <https://discord.gg/Rtxd7eH>

## Student Deals and Licenses
You may or may not be aware that being a college student more often than not entitles you to a student discount to a variety of things, from software subscriptions, to Spotify premium, to food in restaurants. It might seem awkward at first, but if you wish to save a fairly significant amount of money, you should ***absolutely*** make use of this discount at every chance you get. Remember *there is no harm in trying*. Whenever you order at a restaurant ask "Do you have a student discount?", if you ever see a piece of software online send them an email asking "Do you have a student discount?". The phrase "Do you have a student discount?" should be the first thing you say to anyone for the rest of your time in college.

But whats better than a discount? Getting something for the low, low price of **FREE**. By having an email address registered with the college you are entitled to a number of pieces of software and digital services for free.

### GitHub Pro
Whilst its use may not be immediately apparent at the start of Computer Science, over the course of the coming years you will find that GitHub is perhaps one of the most useful tools to a programmer allowing you to store, log and collaborate on both your college and personal projects.

Having a Pro membership on GitHub grants you a few neat features, but perhaps the most useful is the ability to create private repositories (projects). This is especially important if you want to avoid getting hit by the colleges plagiarism detection as having exam related material in a public repo is against the rules.

It is also worth noting that the GitHub Pro membership is tied to your college email, and seeing as the college will never delete your student email, you effectively have free GitHub Pro for life.

### Office 365
This one is pretty self explanatory! All the classics, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc. All for FREE! All you have to do is download the installer from the website and sign in with your college email!

### Microsoft Azure
Being an SCSS student entitles you do a number of developer centric software straight from Microsoft, including Windows 10 Pro and Visual Studio. Simply sign into the Azure portal to claim your keys and downloads!

### Jetbrains Suite
Perhaps the most useful of all the software listed here! Jetbrains offer an entire suite of IDEs for nearly any language you could imagine, all with amazing syntax highlighting/code formatting/debugging tools/etc. And what's best of all it includes fantastic support for a variety of Version Control Systems, which will remove a significant portion of headaches for the Programming Project.

## Don't Trust WYSIWYG
We've all tried to add an image to a Word document only to have it move everything around and still end up in the wrong place.

Over the course of your course you will have to submit a number of essays and write-ups. My recommendation is to never use 'What You See Is What You Get' software like Microsoft Word for these assignments as they will only lead to headaches and slow you down in the long run. Instead I recommend using a markup language, particularly LaTeX. This may seem incredibly daunting to learn at first, but after your first go you will realise that its syntax is incredibly simple, but extremely flexible. Not only will it allow you to make your documents look more professional, but it will save you a lot of time in the long run.

I personally would recommend using Overleaf, which is a free online LaTeX interpreter with a live preview of your document.
